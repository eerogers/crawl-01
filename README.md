# crawl-01
Crawl allows you create web crawls and plan the details with your friends. Simply choose to "Create a Crawl" on the splash page, note the automatically-generated password and send it to your friends along with the crawl id. They can then join you in the crawl's main page, where a search of locations will return bars that might be suitable for your pub crawl. (It will also let you know what the weather in that location is looking like.) You can add items to your itinerary and communicate with your friends using a provided chat window, both of which are private to your group.
